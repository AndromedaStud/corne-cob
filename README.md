## Project Status
**Version:** v0  

> This version is still in development and not yet ready for production.

---

## Overview
**Corne Cob** builds on the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) layout and extends [Narkoleptika’s josukey](https://github.com/Narkoleptika/josukey) using [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz/).  
It’s designed with improved ergonomics, better hardware support, and a few quality-of-life enhancements.

## Key Features and Additions
Compared to **josukey**, Corne Cob includes:

- OLED display for real-time system feedback  
- Larger battery for extended wireless use  
- Angled case for improved typing comfort  
- Nice!Nano-specific footprint for wireless builds  
- Separate left and right PCBs for easier assembly  
- 1.5u thumb key support for flexible keymapping  
- 6-column design (versus the standard 5-column Corne)

---

## Built With
- [Ergogen](https://ergogen.xyz/) — PCB and case generation  
- [KiCad](https://kicad.org/) — schematic and layout editing  
- [josukey](https://github.com/Narkoleptika/josukey) — base layout inspiration

## Roadmap
- [ ] Finalize v1 PCB layout  
- [ ] Test case fit and alignment  
- [ ] Validate power delivery and charging circuit  
- [ ] Release build guide and firmware configuration
