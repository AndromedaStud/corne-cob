Project Status

Version: v0

This version is still in development and not yet ready for production.

Overview

Corne Cob builds on the Corne
 layout and extends Narkoleptika’s josukey
 using Ergogen
.
It’s designed with improved ergonomics, better hardware support, and a few quality-of-life enhancements.

Key Features and Additions

Compared to josukey, Corne Cob includes:

OLED display for real-time system feedback

Larger battery for extended wireless use

Angled case for improved typing comfort

Nice!Nano-specific footprint for wireless builds

Separate left and right PCBs for easier assembly

1.5u thumb key support for flexible keymapping

6-column design (versus the standard 5-column Corne)

Built With

Ergogen
 — PCB and case generation

KiCad
 — schematic and layout editing

josukey
 — base layout inspiration

Roadmap

 Finalize v1 PCB layout

 Test case fit and alignment

 Validate power delivery and charging circuit

 Release build guide and firmware configuration

Acknowledgements

Special thanks to Narkoleptika for the original josukey
 project, and to the Ergogen and Corne communities for their open-source contributions.

Would you like me to add a short “How to build” or “Contributing” section next (for when it becomes ready to share)?
